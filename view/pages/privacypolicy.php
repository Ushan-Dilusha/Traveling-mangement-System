                <p>7. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites, applications, or other services or by your mobile operating system operator, wireless carrier, or other similar

                <p>8. DO-NOT-TRACK SIGNALS AND SIMILAR MECHANISMS Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is
                    not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such
                    signals, the Website and Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. We will only use cookies and similar
                    tracking technologies as detailed in Section 9 below. </p>
                <p>9. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES 9.1 WHAT ARE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES? Cookies are small pieces of data being placed on the hard drive of a visitor’s device. With the help of cookies you can store information for a
